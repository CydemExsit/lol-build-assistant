_Status legend_: ✅ end-to-end on snapshots; ⚠️ partial parser gaps; ❌ broken.

## Runtime coverage (live mode, not part of quickstart)
Live scraping can target additional champions when Playwright is enabled, but coverage varies and is not validated here. See [`ISSUES_TODO.md`](ISSUES_TODO.md) for the non-blocking roadmap to bring live mode back safely.
